    "description": "Every OpenCV journey starts here: loading an image from disk and understanding what it actually is in memory.\n\nWhen you call `cv2.imread()`, OpenCV reads the file and returns a **NumPy array** — a grid of numbers. Each number represents a pixel's color intensity. This is the foundation of everything in computer vision.\n\n**What does an image look like in memory?**\nA color image is a 3D array with shape `(height, width, channels)`. For a 300×400 color image:\n- `img.shape` → `(300, 400, 3)`\n- The 3 channels are **Blue, Green, Red** (not RGB — OpenCV uses BGR order!)\n\n**Why BGR and not RGB?**\nHistorical reason: early camera hardware stored bytes in BGR order. OpenCV kept this convention. Always remember: channel 0 = Blue, channel 1 = Green, channel 2 = Red.",

        "cv2.imread() returns None if the file path is wrong — always check for None before using the image.",
        "OpenCV uses BGR color order, not RGB. This trips up almost every beginner.",
        "img.shape returns (height, width, channels) — note height comes before width.",
        "A grayscale image has shape (height, width) — no channel dimension.",
        "numpy zeros creates a black image: np.zeros((height, width, 3), np.uint8)"
